# The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Machine Learning Engineering Galaxy

A workshop on how to start with MLOps for [ML Conf EU 2020](https://mlconf.eu/).

Updated for LINKIT Virtual Roadtrip "Defrost Your Data".

## Intro
Are you a Software Engineer who got tasked to deploy a machine learning model for the first time in your life? Are you wondering what steps to take and how AI-powered software is different from traditional software? Then it is the right workshop to attend.

The internet offers thousands of articles and free of charge courses, showing how it is easy to train and deploy a simple ML model. At the same time in reality it is difficult to integrate a real model into the current infrastructure, debug, test, deploy, and monitor it properly. In this workshop, I will guide you through this process by sharing tips, tricks, and favorite open source tools that will make your life much easier. So, at the end of the workshop, you will know where to start your deployment journey, what tools to use, and what questions to ask.
